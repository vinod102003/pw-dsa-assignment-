Q1. 5 is the decimal number

2 | 5

—----

2 | 2 1

—----

2 | 1 0

Reading numbers is reverse order gives us 101 as the binary representation


2. Number 10

2 | 10

—-----

2 | 5 0

—-----

2 | 2 1

—-----

2 | 1 0

Reading in reverse order from bottom to top gives us 1010 as the binary representation of 10.


Q2. Number 15. Converting it in binary 1111, as its more than 1 set bits in the binary representation therefore it’s 
not power of 2.


Number 32. Converting it to binary 10000, as it has only 1 set bit, therefore its power of 2.
